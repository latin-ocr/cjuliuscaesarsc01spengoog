20. carrorum· The carrus or ear-rum was a vehicla peculiar ιο

used ιο strengthen the superlative. See Z. § 108. So in the next clause

3 1. Proximo civitatibus, that is, with the neighboring states or
communities of Gaul·

33. Lege, i. e. actu, ao foedere alanni: “they fix by law tho
time of their departure for the third year?

34. Ad cas rea conficiendas· The repetition of these words (see

line ³2) is objected to by Oudendorp, ciacconius, and other critice, and it ,

would seem not without reason. The answer which Davies gives is, that
the Commentaries are not, and were not meant to be regarded as, finfflami
compositions. “ Eae ree (says Dr. Schmitz) here refer· to all the before·
mentioned points: the amba-ny he undertook himself, (sibi ,·) but the
other matters he intrusted to the care of others?

³6. Persuadet takes the dative, (see Ζ. §407 3) the object or wem.

follows, line 38, ut regnum . . . . occuparet.

³6. Regnum . . . . principatum. The former (according to Ramh„ ’

535) signifies ‘⁶ autocracy, regal dignity, government ;’' principatus == ‘⁶ su·
preme place, precedencess’ (See noto, p. 15, line 1.) It seems from this
and other passages, that the sovereign authority was not hereditary in
Gau13 it was probably consen-ed ou the mm who was most highly es·
teemed for justice, bravery, aud other popular qualities.

3‘1. a S. P. R. ..-. a senatu populi Romani. Oudendorp and others
read a S. P. Q. R. = a senatu populoque Romano. The being styled
‘⁶ friend” (amicus) was esteemed a high honor, and source of protection
and a'dvantage to the recipient.

15 1. principatum ln civitate obtinebat· See cap. 165 Et Lisco,

qui summo magistratu praeerat, quem vergobretum appellant Aedui, qui
creatur annuus, et vitae necisque in suos habet potestatem. He is said

ο principatum obtinere, who is the leader of his countrymen, but without

the name of king. Lactant, Dio. Imt. 1, 13. “ Primis ‘Uranus eminere
inter caeteros potentia coeperit, et principatum habere, uon regnum? See
also Caes. Bell. Gall. VII. 4 3 Cujus pater principatum Galliae totius
obtinuerat, et ob eam causam, quod regnum appetebat, ab civitate erat
interfectus. Yet Sulpicius Severus, Hiet. Sacr. 1, 26, relates that
Tbelas obtained the reguum, and Jalrus the principatus, though both had
the same power, so that these words are sometimes eoufounded. (Davies.)

3. Perfacile, &c- Construe, probat illie perficere comta eece per-
facile factu = “ Orgetorix demonstratos ιο them that the accomplishment
of their designa would be very easily effected ;’' more literally, “ that it
