doctrines. In this opinion at least lamblichus, V. P. n. 173, seems to lig
have been. Origen, however, Pham. 2, p. 46, expressly says: '0 τοῦ
Πυθαγόρου clxiv-ns Ζάμολξις τοῦς παρὰ Κελτοῖς Δρυΐδας Mycm διδάξαι φιλοσοφεῖν

16. Exortum. Supply homines. q

24. Ambactos. Schmitz thinks this rs probably not a Latin word,
but a Gallie or Celtic word (andbaht, i. e. min'nter) which denotes persons
who attend upon the nobles. It *ns not impoaeible that Caesar may mean
to explain the word by clientes, the que osten serving· to join an explana-
tion to some preceding word:

stitiosis.

ἐ’-28. Pro victimis homines immolant, ‘⁸ they offer human victims
in sacrifices? This horrible practice is mentioned by other writers, and
it seems to be true-that the religion of the Druid- aisti-tuma human sacti·-

1. Mercurium· This (according ιο Schmitz) cannot have been the 119
Mercnry of the Romans3 and it must be horne in mind that both Greeks
and Romans, when they became acquainted with a new divinity in a
foreign country, forthwith identified it with the one among their own gods
with whom he seemed ιο have any resemblance. The Mercury in this
place is probably the Odin or Wodan of the northern natione, Apollo the
god Belenus, Mars the god Ther, Jupiter the Gallie-god Taren or Tarmia. '
and Minerva is perhaps the goddess os the moon. .

ὅ. Apollinem. Supply colunt.

θα nnio, i· Θ. Mam

lo. auae. It has here a general meaning comprising both animalia
and reliquae res. The meaning is, ‘⁴ whatever they conquer, they trent
in either of two ways3 if the booty consiste of animala, they sacrifice
them3 and if ef any other things, they collect them inte one place.”

( l 'Y . Dite. Dio is the god of the lower world, commonly called Pluto.
By calling themselves his descendants they probably meant to describe

itself.
