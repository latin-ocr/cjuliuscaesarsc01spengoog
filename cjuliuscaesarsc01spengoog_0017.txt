forces under Scipio, in an engagement near nam. and reduced the kingdom
of their ally, suba, king of Mauritania, to a Roman province. On hearing of
Caesar’s success, Cato killed himself at Utica. Returning ιο Rome, Caesar, at
the interval of a few days, triumphed four different times, in consequence of his
having conquered Gaul, Egypt, Pontus, and Africa.

The plunder os so many countries enabled the conqueror of the world ιο glut
his soldiers with presente, and the citizens with lame-en. To danie the eyes
of the multitude, and to diver-t the minda os the citizens from the extinction of
their liberties, he exhibitod shows os uncoinmon magnificentie, and gave seam

Cneius and Sextm, the som of Pompey, aided by labienus, having drawn
together a powerrul army in Spain, Caesar was again obliged to leave Rome,

people, with sorrowsul hear-ts, gazed at the pompous processioa, and stood alent.
No acclamationi followed the car os the conqueror. The 'splendid exhibition

The senate has been blamed sor conferi-ing meh extravagant honora, and sou·

inclinationi os the conqueror, and merely granted what they had then no power

pointed him sapei-intendent os morale, and confemd upon him the title of im-
perator and father of his country. Nor did they stop here. They decreed him
an elevated seat in the theatro, a golden chair in the senate-house, and on the
tribunal in the forum. Το complete their extravagance and impiety, to the
man who had destroyed their constitution, and enslaved his follow-citizens,
they voted temples, altars, and priests. The command of the army, disposui ot·
the treasury, and nomination of the magistrates, he considered ιο be put in his
power by the mcc·- of his arms, hence the concurrence of the senate in these
matters was deemed unneceoeary. Το decoy the people, with some οἱ· mose

which he had in view. It must not be denied that his conduct, when supreme
commander, was marked with great elemency, and that he enacted several
niutan* laws for the better regulation of the state. He administered justice
without partiality, and added to the mune· of the empire by planting Roman
colenies beyond seas. But· his elevated station, as well as the mensures by
which it had been obtained, created him enemies3 and the chief of the senam,
among whom was his most intimate friend Brutus, conspired against his life·
