common consent. The scandalous combination of these three great men was
called the first triumvirate. of the three, Pompey was the least criminal.
He appears ιο have been duped by the insinuating address of Caesar, in whose
cmsulship he expected to get his acts in Asia ratified. The decree could only
gratify his vanity, which was his ruling passion; but the means which he
employed to accomplish it were highly criminal. The olu'ect of Crassus was
ιο add ιο his wealth, and ιο increase his influence in the state, by the power
and talents of- the other two 3 and that of Caesar, by occasionally yielding ιο
Pompey’s same, ιο raise his own, ‘⁸ and crown his mad ambition.”

From this period the state was wholly managed by Caesar: and the violence
of his proceedings rendered the triumviri offlects osjmt abhorrence ιο all classes
of the community. Cicero, ιο whom Pornpey confeoeed he hed been duped
by Caesar, advised. him to break off all connection with that intriguing and
unprincipled politician3 but with him the winning addreoe of Caesar had more
influence, who not only preserved their former intimacy, in opposition ιο the
advice os Cicero, but strengthened their union by giving Pompey, in marriage,
his daughter Julia, a woman of the most amiable dismsitions, and of the most
engaging manners. So great was her influence with both her father and
husband, that, in spite of the mutual jealousy and aversion which afterwards
subsisted between them, she prevented their coming ιο any rupture as long as
she lived. To increase his power in the state, and ιο command the interest ol·
Piso, who succeeded him in the consulship, he married his daughter Calpurnia.
A strong and respectable party, animated by love of their country, then began
warmly to oppose the mensures os the triumvirate. Caesar, anxious to intimi-
date them, bribed Vettius, who had formerly preferred an accusation against
himself, to declare, that he had been urged by some os the nobles to aaeaaeinate
Pompey. But this villainy, being detected by the people, was treated with
such contempt, that he was glad ιο drop it; and to prevent discovery, he put
Vettius ιο death iu prison. Notwithstanding these acts os enormity, he still
raained a very powerful party in the state. Previously ιο the expiration of his
consulship, he obtained from the people, through his agent, the tribune
Vatinius, the province of Gallia Cisalpina, and Illyricum, Upper Albania, with
three legions for five years; and the senate, at the desire of Caesar, added
Gallia Transalpina, and another legion. These legions were gradually iu-
creased to thirteen. Some of the succeeding magistrates wished to annul his
acts, and to prosecute him sor his illegal conduct during his consulship; but,
having the tribunes in'his interest, a veto was put on all their proceedings.

Caesar set out for Gaul, early in the spring of s. c. 58. Of his conquest of
that country, checking the inroads of the Germane, and overrunning part os
Britain, the Commentarios ou the Gallio War contain a rapid but well-written
account. The young reader must not infer, that all his engagements with
these natione are sully recorded, or every circumstance of his conduct with
· regard to them is either minutely or faithfully detailed. Respect for his char-
acter as a man, and a conscionsneae of the injustice of many of his acts, in-

duced him to conceal many particulare, and to hint at, rather than describe, ·

others. His cruelty and injustice in attacking the states in alliance with Rome,
called forth merited reprehension in the senate, when it was even proposed,
that for his abuse of power in that country, he should be given up ιο ι1ιο
enemy. But the splendor of his success prevented that motion from passing
into a law! The first seven books of the Commentarios were written by
Caesar. Το them Hirtius Pansa, at the request of Balbus, added an eighth,
which brings down the narrative of Caesar-’s military operatione in Gallia to
