summer, Caesar had in fact completed the conquest of Gaul, by the defeat
of the formidnble confederwy orgnnized by Vercingetorix and by the cep-
ture of Alesia. By hie saoce-ive victorie- he had amessed a tremum,
which, if we may judge by the effecte ascribed to it, must have been enor-
moue. . . . . To‘his own army his libet-alitio· were almost unbounded, while
his camp presented a place of refuge ιο the needy, the profligate, the
debtors, and even the cfiminals who found it convenient to retreat from
the capital. When it is remembered that the object of all this profusiori
was the enelaving of his country, and that the means which enabled him
ιο pruot'ne it were derived from the unprovoked pillege of the towns end
templee of Gaul, and the sale of those unfortunate barberinae, who in the
course of his unjust ware became his primore, it may be justly doubted
whether the life of any individual recorded in history, was ever productive
of a greater amount of humen niuei-y, or hes been marked with u deeper
stain of wicharium? Arnold’s Later aman commentanda, p. 224.
