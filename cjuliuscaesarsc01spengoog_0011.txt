PREFAGE.

Tun text of the present edition of Caesar-'s Com-
mentaries on the Gallie War is substantially that of
Oudendorp. The variations introduced were drawn
from a careful comparison of Oudendorp’s text with
those of Achaintre and Lemaire, Oberlin, Schneider,
Giani, &c.; and the Editor felt the less hesitation in
adopting this course because of the acknowledged cor-
rupt state of the text* Hence, wherever a reading
appeared to him more in accordance with Caesar's usual
style or manner, he has ventured to adopt it in preser-
ence to the lection of Oudendorp

The sources from which the notes have been mainly
drawn are the following: Oudendorp' s large edition of
the works of Caesar, with the N otes os D. VossiuS,
J. Davies, and Sam. clarite, Stutgard, 1822, 2 vols,
8v0.; Graevius’s edition os Caesar's workS, with the
N otes os Vossius„ DavieS, and others, Leyden‚ 1713,
SVO.; Barker's Caesar's Commentaries on the Gallie

 

θ “The te'xt of Caesar-’s Commentarios is also so corrupt, and hu in'
the later editione been sometimes eo unhappily corrected, that I dread the
period when 1 thail have to follow it ns the main authority of my* narrative,
und can no longer look to Niebuhr’ e nagaeity sor guidunce’ ”—Arnold ι
Hittory osRome, vol, 1., p. 15.
