He died· ιιι the senate—home, March leth. n. e. 44, in the fifty-dnh year os his
age, piemed by· twenty· -three wounds, atter he had enioyed the peaeesul pones-
sion of the empire only ssve *mentha

of Caesel-’s intrepidity es a soldier, and abilities ns a emmander, the armies
which he defeated, and the countries whieh he eonqueied, are sufficient prooss.
To the talents of a eonsummate general, he added those of an elegant histor-iau
and a perussive mator. Mneh οἱ· his eommentaries, οι· Journal: os the Gallie
and civil wars, were, it is said, compo-ed on the spot where his battles were
fondit- The purity and neatneoe ot· his style, notwithstanding the rapidity
with which he must have written, have not been surpased· by any Roman
writer. His narrative is perspicuum, simple, and natural. It is at ones chaete
aad animated. Hinlueid aad picturaque description piam the whole scens
distinctly before the reader, who aecempenies him in all his mai-ebes, and is a
minimos every engagement: Few nonages oeeur in his writings. which the
moet illiterato do not understand, and the most polished do not approve. To
eompose a simple narrative ot* his campaigns, for the amusement of himen· and
his friends, seems rather to have been his efflent, than to give a specimen os his
talents as a profound historiam or deep politieian. Henee, it were absurd, to
expect in the commentarios a finished history. They are mere outline& which
he, pez-glane, entertained the hope of seeing filled up, either by himself, or by
smne ο er hand.

Besida a few ,iuvenile pieees mentioned by Suetonius, and a collection o!
apophtheng,Caesar lest, at his death, two books on Grammar, and s poem
which he ealled Iter, er the Journey. But these, with his letters to the senate
and his friends, are now lost. None of his writings now romain, except seven
books of the Gallie and three of the Civil wer. The eighth book of the Gallio
war, as formerly mentioned, is the composition of A. Hirtius Panem but it is
not known who wrote the aeeonnts of the Alexandrino, African, and Spanish
wars- ψ
Os Caesar’s talents as an orator, we have the opinion of Cicero and Quin-
tilian. His orations were admired for two qualities, not always united, strength
and eloganee. Cieero places him among the first oratore, and Quintilian as-
serts he spoke with the same spirit with which he fought. Had not ambition‚
says that great critic. diverted Caesar nan the- arts of peaes, he weiild have
rivalled the eloqtienee ot· Cicero.
