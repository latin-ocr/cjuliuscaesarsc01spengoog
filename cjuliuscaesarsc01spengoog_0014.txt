”comant aim. ln the putauit of hisfavorite plam, he had recem-e to means
the most wicked and fiagitious. But, in spite os his vicen* the agreeableness
of his manners and splendor οἱ his talents, added to his martial valor and·
intrepidity, gained him many admirere. The succes of his military enterprises
rendered him a favorite with the army, and his ρωίιιεο bribery secnred in
his interest the populace of Rome. That his οῌοοι, from his early years,
had been his own aggrandizement on the ruin of his country, is manifest
from his having been concerned, first, in the conspiracy os Oranus and Sylla,
and, asterwards, in that of Catiline.† The judgment which he gave in the
senate. with respect to the puninlunent os Lentulus, Cethegus, dcc.. accom-
plices of Catiline, the conduct cf the Roman Equites who guarded the temple
where the senate was met, and his being arraigned as an associate os that
rebel, before the Quaestor and the senate, sufficienti! prove both the public
opinion and his guilt. He leagued with these naitors, not to promote their
schemes, but by their means to desti-oy the liberties of his country, and become
the unlimited sovereign of Rome.

Caesar divorced Pompeia, because Clodius had been detected in his house,
while she and other matrons were celebrating the rites of Bona Dea. from
which every male creature was most caresully excluded. Clodius was tried
for this crime, and, through bribery, obtained a sentence of acquittal. As
Clodius was a man os great influence and popularity, Caesar, although cer-
tain of the fact, declined bearing evidence against him, lest it should have,
at any future period, been in the uallest degree iniurious to his plans of am-
bition.‡

The senate seem to have been apprehensive of the power and influence of
Caesar. By this tirne he was elected consul, which induced them to decree
provinces of little or no importance, woods and roads, to the consuls for that
year. This provoked his resentment‚ and he labored to effect a reconciliation

, between Pompoy and Crassus, which he at last, aster great exertion‚ accom-
plished. The interest of the former he had keenly supported in the passing os
the Manilian law, which conferred extraordinary powers on that commender,
and likewise on other occasions, though not without an ultimate view to his
own advantage. Whatever power, beyond what was usual, had been assigned
ιο others, served as a precedent sor his soliciting the like for himself. With
Oramus, a man of prodigious wealth‚ but of no great personal merit, he had
long been in habits of sriendship. Of all the Roman citizens, Pompey possessed
the greatest power, Crassus the greatest riches, and Caesar the greatest abilities.
In this coalition, which was in fact a conspiracy against the liberties of Rome,
they solemnly swore that nothing was to be done in the state but by their

* Whilst Caesar was giving tokens of the danger which the aristocracy had to
apprehend from his political career, he almost lulled their fears by the unbounded
infamy of his personal character. We will not, and cannot repeat the picture
which ancient writers, little scrupulous on such points, have drawn of his debauch-

' eries; it will be sufficient to say, that he was stained with numerous adulterim,
committed with women of the noblest farnilies3 that his profligacies in other
points drew upon him general disgrace, even amidst the lax morality cf his own
contemporaries, and are such that their very fiagitiousness has in past saved them
from the abhorrence of posterity, because modern writers cannot pollute their
pages with the mention of them.—Arnold’s Later Romen commorassem, p. 149.

† Caesar’s connection with the conspiracy of Catiline is doubted and even denied
by some of the best modern writers. There does not appear to be sufficient evi

dence ιο convict him of any direct participation in that sanguinary scheme.
