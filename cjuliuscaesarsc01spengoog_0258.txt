sYNoPSIS.

caesar made extensive preparations for a second expedition into Britain, and
alter being engaged tor a time in suppressing the incursione of the Pirustae
and the insurrection os the Treviri, he assembled a body oi* Gallie cavalry and
set sail tor the island. The naval equipment consisted of more than 800
vessels of ali orders, and the military force amounted to five legions and 200⁰
cavalry. The Britons terrified, ssed for refuge to the woods.

navins fonifled a camp on the coast, and left a few troops to protect the stripping,
caesor pursued the enemy within the forests, forced their intrenchments
thoro, nd his army was in full pur-suit ot them, when n party of horse arrived
from his admitti with the intelligence, that in a sudden tempest many of his
ships hed been lost, and the greater part had sustained serious damage.

On his return, he found that the loss amounted to about forty vessels. By daily
and nightly exertion on the part of his soldiers, he, in the space of ten days,
hed the rest hauled up close to his camp, and rendered them secure by extend-
ing the fortifications so as to enclose them. Prompt mensures were adopted
for the repair of these, and for the construction of others on the coast of Gaul.
During this interval, Caesar was employed in collecting information in refer·
enee to the statistics of the country, its position and extent, and the orig-in and.
peculiarities of its various inhabitants.

'rho chief command of the Britons was conseri-ed on cassivellaunus, the leader

' in highest repnte among theim and, from their desultory mode of fighting,
anssr now met with the same diffimilties that he had experienced in his first
encounter with these tribes. Their rapidity in charging and retreating, dis-
appointed the efforts of his beaw-armed legions, whileparties of the cavalry
were diverted to a distance, and overpowered by the enemy. At length. by
their rashness‚ having committed themselves to a disadvantageous position,
the Britons sustained a severe reverse, and shortly aster, all abandoned Cassi-
vellaunus, save four thousand charioteers. The Romans, crossing the Thames,

’ entered his territories, and took by assault his principal encampment.

In this situation of his affairs, the British chief made proposals for peace. These
were readily accepted ; for, as Caesar suspected that fresh insurrections were
on the eve of breaking out in Gaul, he deemed it expedient that his troops
should go into winter-quartem on the Continent.

A scarcity ot provisions obliged Caesar to distribute his army among the several
states, inconsequence of which the whole country was up in arms. The Eburo-
nes massacred the troops under the command of Titurius Sabinus, and, joining
with the Nervii, besieged the quarters of Q. Cicero, the brother of the famous
orator. After a brave defence he was relieved by Caesar, who was occupied
the whole winter in Gaul in watching and suppressing various insurrections.

The Treviri, under command of 1ndutiomarus, prepare for wer. and venture to
attack the camp of Labienus. In a saliy from the camp, Indutiomarus is siaiu,
and the (ἰωὴ dispersed ; the country generally becomes more composed.
