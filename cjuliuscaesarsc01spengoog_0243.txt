26. Aer-ariae necturae, ‘⁴ copper mines.” Some MSS. have stric-

which iron ore is obtained by means of the furnace.’' Schneider reads,
aerariae structuraque, i. e. “ mines and subterraneous structures or pas-

iu the text, however, (which is that of Oudendorp) is the most generally
approved.-Diligentia nostrornm, ‘⁴ on account of the vigilance of our

and others.

voted themselves. Diodorus asserts that the Greek soldiers used to take a

mane to return alive from a field of battle -where their prince had fallen.
