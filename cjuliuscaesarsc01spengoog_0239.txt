1 ’1. Venetlam. Not a town, but the country of the Veneti. &aniz-3

and others take it to be a town, the modern Vannes.

18. Socios, διο. “ Caesar no longer concealing his design of sub-
duing Gaul, undertook the reduction of all the coast tribes. He pene·
trated the sorests «and marshes of the Menapii and Morini, (Zealand and
Guelders, Ghent, Bruges, Boulogne 3) while one of his lientenants sub-
dued the Unelli, Eburovices, and Lexovii, (Contances, Evreux, Li-
seux 3) and another, the young Crassus, conquered Aquitaine, although
the barbariam had summoned to their aid from Spain, the old brothers-in-
arms of Sertorius. Caesar himself attached the Veneti and other tribes
of our Brittany. This amphibious race inhabited neither the land nor tho
water. Their forts erected on peninsulas alternately inundated and de·-
serted by the tide, could be besieged neither by the one nor the other.
The Veneti maintained a constant communication with the other Britain,
and was supplied from it. To reduce them, it was necessary to be master
of the sea. Nothing checked Caesar. He built veneis, fonned sailors,
and taught them to secure the Breton ships by using grappling-irons and
cutting their ropes· He treated hardly this hard peop103 but the leesor
Britain could only be conquered through the greater. Caesar made up
his mind to invade it.” Michelet’s History os Franco, vol. i. p. 47.

24. Injuriae . . . . equitum. The equites are the persons sent as
legati, who were of equasti-ian rank, and the injuriae retentorum equitum
(See A. and S. ᾗ 274, Rem. 5)ss the wrong consisting in detaiuing them,
though the personal wrongs which they suffered may be meant to be
included—Rabonio . . . . desectio. See Ramsh. 324. ,

26. In primis, ne. Supply metue or cura, a noun of sear or ap-
prehension being implied before nei—Hac parte, scil. Galliae.—Neglecta,
i. e. non unita.

28. gallos . . . . studere. The natural ficklenees and levity of the
Gauls were almost proverbial.

‘ ³4. Mandat . . . . adeat . . . . contineat, scil. ut. Ut is often omit-
ted before the subjunctive, aster verbs of aeking, reminding, &c See
A.and s.§262,1³em.4

36. Auxilio· A very old MS. has in auxilio, “ among the auxili-
aries,'’ a reading which Oudendorp does not dieapprove.

38. Cum cohortibus legionariis duodcclm· As a legion con-
sisted of ten cohorte, Crassus had of course under his command one legion
and two cohorte.

1. Gallim, i. e. Celtic Gaul.

3. Eam manum, instead of eorum manum, meaning the forces of
the Unelli and the others.

8. Exn-emis ungulis, “ on the extreme points of tongues of land?
These. were not so elevated as the promontories.

1 1. Bis . . . . XXIV· Oudendorp reads bis . . . . XII„ according
to the MSS„ but it seems difficult to reconcile the fact that the tides are
twelve honre apert, with the words in the text? The Oxford ΜΒ. omit·
