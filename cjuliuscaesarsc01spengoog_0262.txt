Hagno negotio, ‘⁴ with great trouble.”

20. Fabros· Each legion had a certain number affabri, “ artifi- .

cen? who worked in wood, ἰιοιι, διο.

21. Posset· The imperfect subjunctive is here med instead of
possit, becauoe the leading verb scribit is an historica! present for scripsit.
(Schmitz.)

24. Subduct- Cf. note, p. 85, line 6.

30. Summa . . . . administrandi, ‘⁶ the supreme command and di-
rection of the war.’'

33. Tamesis, the Thames. The territory ef Cassivellaunus was
north of the Theman, and the place where Caesar met him was eighty
miles from the point where he had landed his troops. lt cannot refer to
the mouth of the river, since Caesar knew nothing of its course.

34. coutinentia, “ continual or unintermpted.” See Bk. ΙΙΙ. 28.

³⁹1. Natos in insula ipsa = ‘⁶ whose ancestors sprung from Britain
itself.” There is a similar expression in Thac. 1, Τὴν γοῦν Ἀττικὴν ἄνθρω-
ποι ᾤκουν οἱ εὔνοι’ ἀεὶ, Schol. τῷ γένει «δηλονότι, οὗ γὰρ ἦσαν aeduam. The
most ancient natione thought themselves αὐτόχθονας, because having long
dwelt in the same country, they at length forgot their origin. (Davies.)

38. Memoria· The dative is mere common. The ablative signifies

been frequently noticed before. Caesar often uses it.

2. Bello mato, i. e. when the war was finished.

6. Aere. See note, p. 82, line 8.-—-Taleis. These were thin or small
staves. Being properly of wood, ferreis is added, to show that those used
t'or money were of this latter substance. It is plain from this that the
Britons had no coinage, but, like the early Romans, determined the value
of pieces of metal by their weight.

'Y- Plumbum album, i. e. tin, the κασσίτερος of the Greeks. The
mines are in Cornwall, the southwestern part of England. Hence Caesar
is wrong in asserting that it is found' ιιι the interior.

9. Materia, wwd, i. e. trees. .

1 1. mum. .causa,‘ ‘for the sake of amusement and pleneme-’¹

12. Loca» This, like aer and coela-m, may be rendered by‘ ‘cli-
mate-’⁹ (Schmitz. )

14. Insula natura triquetra. From this (generally) accurate
description of Britain some writers collected that these Commentarioe
were not the productiori of Caesar, because it was not ascertained till the
reign ot* Claudius that Britain was an island. See Die, 39, p. 1143 see
also Tacit. Agr. 10. But Caesar obtained this information from repert,
and also what he says about the Britons in the interior ef the island, · for
he never penetrated into the interior, and hence Pomponius Mela, 3, 6,

ῗὶιὲςνιζὶιςιαιω Claudius that Britain had been at length discovered.
