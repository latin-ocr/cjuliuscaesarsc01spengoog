edition3 Andrews', Leverett's‚ and Paterson’s editions
os the Commentarios on the Gallie War‚ dno. From
these sources principally‚ added to the frequent perusals
of the author with the classes under his charge, it has
been the Editor’s aim to prepare such notes as would be
of service to the 'young student in entering upon⁶ the
consecutive perusal of a Latin author. In how far the
Editor may have succeeded in carrying out his design,
it becomes him not to say; he ean only trust that
his efforts to illustrate and render attractive a favori te
classic may meet with similar indulgence to that which
has been bestowed upon his former contributions to the
great ca'use of classical learning.
