BOOK SEVENTH.

eYNorsm.

The cruelly ses ere course pursued by Caesar, in regard to the Eburones and the

Gauls generally, and the intelligence which had been received from Italy of
civil commotione, induced the Gauls to form nevv pians for carrying on the
war against Caesar. The Carnutes and Arverni, at the instigation of Vercin-
getorix, (the general-in-chiem first commence hostilitia. Caesar returns
vaith some difficulty to his army and enters the country οἱ the Arverni, which
obliges the Gallie generat to leave the north, whither he had gone, and defend
the parts attached by Caesar. Several towns are taken by the Romans, and
the inhabitants put to the swerd.

Vercingetorix proposes another plan of carrying on the war, and assui-es his

countrymon that the only hope of safety is in starving out the Roman army,
and to do this it is necessary to burn down their own towns. The Bituriges
do so with all theirs, (twenty in number,) except Avaricum, the finest city in
Gaul. 'Phe Romam suffer much in consequence of want of provisions, aad
endum their privatione with great fortitude‘. Vercingetorix, acmised of trea-
son, defends himself successfully and endeavors to suecos· Avaricum. The
city, however, is taken after severe fighting, and most of the inhabitants are
massacred.

‘rho Aedui, the iii-mest and best friends of the Maiam, revolt, partly in secret,

from Caesar, and thus disappoint him os his expected force oi· cavalry. Cae·
sar does what he can in the emergency; but his soldiers attacking Gergovia
too eagerly, are repulsed with great loss. Caesar censures the rashness of his
troops on this occasion, abandons the siege and retires into the country ot tho
Aedui. Labienus in the north gains a victory over the Parisii, and rejoins
caesar.

Tho Gauls, under the command of Vercingetorix, continue the war with vigor.

A furious battle is fought, in which caesar gains the victory by a charge ‚of
his German cavalry.

Vercingetorix retreats to Alesia, a town extremely well rortified‚ and sends a

summoue to all Gaul to come to his aid. Caesar circumvallatos the town
and the Gallie camp with vast works, enclosing a circuit of fifteen miles. Α
very large army is collected from all quartem, who make most earnest
efforts to relieve their countrymen in Alesia; but in vain. The besieged, hard
pressed and suffering from scarcity of provisions, vigorously second the efforts
of their friends without Caesar's intrenchments, but to no purpose. violent
contests serve only to confirm the superiority of the Romana and dravv on
the final result. At last, in despair, Vercingetorix and Alesia surrender.

With this the campaign of the present year is concluded, and the army goes into

winter-quartem.
